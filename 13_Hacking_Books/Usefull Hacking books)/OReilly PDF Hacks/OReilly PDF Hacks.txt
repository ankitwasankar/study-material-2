PDF Hacks unveils the true promise of Portable Document Format, 
going way beyond the usual PDF as paged output mechanism. PDF 
expert Sid Steward draws from his years of analyzing, extending, 
authoring, and embellishing PDF documents to present 100 clever 
hacks--tools, techniques, quick-and-dirty or not-so-obvious 
solutions to common problems. The little-known tips and tricks in 
this book are ideal for anyone who works with PDF on a regular 
basis, including web developers, pre-press users, forms creators, 
and those who generate PDF for distribution. Learn how to create 
PDF documents that are far more powerful than simple 
representations of paper pages. The hacks in the book cover the 
full range of PDF functionality, from the simple to the more 
complex, including generating, manipulating, annotating, and 
consuming PDF information. You'll learn how to manage content in 
PDF, navigate it, and reuse it as necessary. Far more than another 
guide to Adobe Acrobat, the book covers a variety of readily 
available tools for generating, deploying, and editing PDF.
