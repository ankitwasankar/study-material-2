<BR>

<P>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a fairly new invention. In 1989, researchers at CERN (a European Lab for Particle Physics) wanted to share information between nodes on their network. The researchers automated the process of locating files on remote machines 
and then copying the required information to their local machines. This retrieval process had to be done with a standard interface, regardless of the type of data or the means of getting this data. This meant that the interface had to include almost all 
the data retrieval tools such as FTP, Gopher, and so on, and be able to handle graphical, text, and binary files with a consistent interface.

<BR>

<P>The resulting network was such a success that the method caught on with users worldwide and gave us the World Wide Web. The letters WWW are now synonymous with the word Internet. The number of sites offering Web services is growing every day.

<P>To access the services on the Web, you need a browser. A browser is an application that knows how to interpret and display documents it finds on the Web. Documents on the Web are encoded in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Hypertext documents 
contain special codes that tell the browser how to locate information on the Web. How the browser interprets the codes is left as a local issue. Some browsers such as Lynx ignore any requests for inline images; some older Mosaic browsers ignore the 
interactive Forms that a user can fill in while online.

<BR>

<P>The latest version is available from the Internet at the following FTP sites:

<BR>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu">sunsite.unc.edu</A> in the directory /pub/Linux/system/Network/info-systems/Mosaic.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI>There are several files in here with version numbers 2.0 and higher. The 2.5 version was the most recent stable one on my system at the time I wrote this chapter. Your mileage may vary. I used the file Mosaic-2.5.bin.tar.gz as my starting point. FTP to 
this site and get the latest version for yourself.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI><A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu">tsx-11.mit.edu</A> is a mirror site for sunsite. Use this site if sunsite appears to be very busy.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI>Another excellent site for Web documents is the FTP site <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu">ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>. Look under the /Web directory tree for a whole forest of documents on the Web, source code, and versions of Mosaic.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI>If you have access to the Web already through another source, you should look at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</A> for information about the Web, latest source code, and other Web-related documents.

<BR>

<BR>

</UL>

<P>After you get the files from these sources, you have to unzip the files via GNU's gunzip program. The gunzip program removes the .gz extension after it unzips a file.

<BR>

<P>The commands to do this are shown next. Substitute the name of the Mosaic version you get for the word myfile here.

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">$ ls myfile*

myfile.tar.gz

$ gunzip file.tar.gz

$ ls myfile*

myfile.tar

$ tar -xf myfile.tar

...</FONT></PRE>

<P>After the dust settles from the tar extraction command (the -x option is for extract), you have the file Mosaic in your directory. Along with these files, you also have some app-defaults files that you can use to customize your copy of Mosaic. As with 
other X applications, almost all of Mosaic's features can be customized using the Xdefaults file with the Mosaic resource. For example, to set the home page use this line:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">Mosaic*HomePage : &quot;http://www.another.nicer.site.com/myfile&quot;</FONT></PRE>

<P>Alternatively, you can set the WWW_HOME environment variable to the path shown above. Using the environment variable is more consistent with other UNIX platforms.

<BR>

<P>The distributions from NCSA include the app-defaults files for each version of Mosaic. After you have installed Mosaic on your machine, edit these files to customize your own files. Read the app-defaults files for all the resources that are available to 
you for your version of Mosaic.

<BR>

<P>Now, you can fire up Mosaic from within an xterm with the command Mosaic. (It's probably best to have Mosaic run in the background so as not to tie up your xterm.) When Mosaic is up, it attempts to load its default hypertext document called the Home 
Page. Basically, the Home Page is the first document you start off with and the one document that you know that you can always load if you get lost while browsing the Web.

<BR>

<P>Before you go browsing the Web, let's first talk about hypertext documents. Once you know how hypertext documents work, you'll find it easier to browse the Web. Be patient; the next section is worth your time to read.

<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>

<CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Hypertext Document and HTML Basics</B></FONT></CENTER></H3>

<BR>

<P>Hypertext documents contain links to other documents on the Web. Links are often called hyper-links. They enable you to access other documents and services on the Internet. You surf the Net by accessing other documents through these links. It's fairly 
easy to create these hypertext documents with links, so you can create your own documents with sites that you regularly visit and find interesting.

<BR>

<P>To create a hypertext document for display on a Web server, you have to learn the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which is a collection of styles that define the various components of a document. HTML is based on SGML (Standardized General Markup 
Language), a superset standard of marking documents.

<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

<BR>

<NOTE>So why write your own Web page?

<BR>There are many reasons that you would want to create your own HTML documents. The first reason is for exposure. Your own document on the Internet can have information about you or topics that you find interesting. You can have a page about your 
business, because a Web address on a business card does look cool. Just remember not to spam your page's address on the Internet; it's not polite. (Spamming is the slang word for posting multiple copies of a message to many unrelated newsgroups.)

<BR>Second, a Web page can be a repository of your favorite sites on the Internet. While cruising the Net, if you come across a decent page or two, you can simply edit your own Web page to add this site. Then, it's simply a matter of bringing up your 
favorite page to get back to the old sites again.

<BR>Last, you may decide to dump Mosaic and go with a newer, better browser that doesn't read the hotlists you created from Mosaic. For example, you have to jump through hoops to get your Windows browsers' hotlists into UNIX Mosaic, or vice versa. When all 
your data is in a Web document, all you have to do is load the document in there, and you are done&#151;no formats, hoops, and magic potions.</NOTE>

<BR>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>

</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Mosaic can display ASCII text files. Therefore, you really don't need to know HTML to write up an HTML document. Any old file will do. However, if you want to have a document formatted when accessed by a viewer such as Mosaic, you must code it with 
HTML. HTML documents are also called source files. Source files are in plain text format and can be created using any text editor.

<BR>

<P>Let's get into a bit more detail about HTML formatting codes, called tags. HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (&lt;), followed by some coding (called the directive), and closed by a right angle bracket (&gt;). HTML tags are generally paired, as 
with &lt;H1&gt; and &lt;/H1&gt;. The ending tag looks just like the starting tag except a slash (/) precedes the directive within the brackets. For example, &lt;H1&gt; tells the viewer to start formatting a top-level heading, and &lt;/H1&gt; tells the 
viewer that the heading is complete.

<BR>

<P>HTML tags are inserted in the source files to tell Mosaic (or some other Web viewer) how to interpret or display the coded information. For example, citation tags are defined by Mosaic to be displayed in italics. Each time you enclose a book title 
between &lt;cite&gt; and &lt;/cite&gt; tags, Mosaic automatically displays the text in italics. This is known as a logical style, because it is configured by the viewer. Viewers can interpret a logical style in different ways.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>

<CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Hyperlinks</B></FONT></CENTER></H4>

<BR>

<P>The chief power of HTML comes from its capability to link regions of text (and also images) to another document (or an image, movie, or audio file). These regions are highlighted to indicate that they are hypertext links. To create a hyperlink, a 
special HTML code is entered that includes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A URL is the way of telling your Web browser where and how to get the information. You can jump directly to URLs to see whether they are valid by using the URL command from the 
File menu. Enter the URL in the dialog box, and Mosaic attempts to get it for you. (See Figure 56.1.)

<BR>

<P><B> <A HREF="56rhl01.gif">Figure 56.1. Jumping hyperlinks via URLs.</A></B>

<BR>

<P>At the same time, text or a graphic is designated to serve as the anchor (the information that is displayed in color or underlined and clicked on). A hyperlink may be made to a remote or local server, depending on how the URL is encoded.

<BR>

<P>You can keep a history of information space navigation, which tracks where you've been. You now have quick access to frequently used documents via a personal list. (See Figure 56.2.) History lists are valid for a current session only. Hotlists are those 
lists that you want to keep for all future sessions. (See Figure 56.3.) You should enter those places here that you may like to visit in a future session.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>

<CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Inline Images</B></FONT></CENTER></H4>

<BR>

<P>Mosaic can display images inside documents, making it a highly visual medium for your information. However, each image requires processing time, which slows down the initial display of the document. Using a particular image multiple times in a document 
causes very little performance degradation compared to using the image only once.

<BR>

<P>An image is sized before it is included in a document. Images can fill a screen. Or, they can be small images that save time when Mosaic displays the document, but are still large enough to present information and be a teaser for the larger image 
displayed in a separate window.

<BR>

<P>An image tag is coded into the source file to tell Mosaic that an image is to be displayed. The image tag is an HTML extension, first implemented in Mosaic. You can test your Web pages by loading this file locally to see how it looks. You don't 
necessarily have to be connected to the Internet to do this.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Where To Get More Help on HTML</B></FONT></CENTER></H4>

<BR>

<P>When you have Mosaic, you have access to online help for writing your own HTML documents. To get The Beginner's Guide to HTML select On HTML... from the help menu. You have to be on the Internet for this to work, because Mosaic accesses the Web to get 
the latest copy for you. This file provides up-to-date information in far greater detail than what you are reading right now. You should print this guide out for future reference. See also Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML in 14 Days (Sams 
Publishing).

<P>The authors of the first NCSA Mosaic have formed their own company called Netscape Communications. Their new brainchild is called Netscape, and you can get a Linux version of it for yourself.

<BR>

<P>The format for using Netscape is very similar to that of Motif. You can use URLs to type your destination name or use the point-and-click method to navigate HTML documents.

<P>Even though this file states &quot;do not edit,&quot; you can get away with a few changes via a text editor. Keep in mind though, that any changes you make through the preferences dialog in the main screen may override what you edited manually.

<BR>

<P>The &quot;N&quot; display at the top right-hand corner of your display shows shooting stars as files are downloaded. If you want to stop any further transfers, you can click your mouse on this icon.

<BR>

<P>The bookmark feature is a bit more intuitive than for Mosaic. In fact, for some people, it's a bit easier to use and edit.

<BR>

<P>Netscape creates a .netscape_cache directory in your home directory, primarily for keeping track of images for HTML files. The size of this directory can get quite big after a few sessions of Netscape. Once in a while, if you are short of disk space, 
delete the files in this directory and the history file called .netscape-history file.

<BR>

<P>Another file of interest would be the .netscape-history file. This file can get large, too, after a few months of Web browsing, because this is where Netscape tracks where you have been. You can use this file as a guide to hunt for that special location 
that you just cannot remember now. If only my memory were this easily accessible.

reasons.

<BR>

<P>Installation is easy. Get the file from the www.netscape.com site and un-tar it. You will have all the executables and associated files in a subdirectory.

<NOTE>If you are using Netscape Version 1.1, you will get an error or warning message that the environment variable XNLSPATH does not contain the correct config files. This causes the program to crash if you cut and paste text in its text fields. The 
included files have to be placed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/nls, or you should set XNLSPATH to the nls subdirectory where you installed netscape.

<BR>Your best course of action would be to get Netscape 2.01 (or the latest version) from the Web site at <A HREF="http://www.mcom.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">http://www.mcom.com/comprod/mirror/index.html</A>.</NOTE>

<P>Setting up a SLIP connection is necessary if you are not already on the Internet. To get a dialup SLIP connection you have to use the /sbin/dip program. The dip stands for Dialup Internet Protocol. For a dedicated connection you should use the slattach

<P>The dip program uses a script file to connect you to a SLIP account. You need a SLIP account to use Mosaic. Using dip with a -t option can also let you run in interactive mode for debugging, but in most cases you use it with a script file.

<BR>

<P>A script file is basically a file that handles your login and setup for you. You invoke /sbin/dip with the script name as an argument. A sample script file to work with my Internet SLIP account is shown in Listing 56.2. Your Internet provider should 
provide a script for you. If it does not provide one, ask for it.

<P>Listing 56.2 shows how to access an Internet service provider via a dialup SLIP account. This script gives you an example of how to log into the remote system and get your local address, and even asks you for the remote IP address.

<BR>

<P>Normally, you run the SLIP script as root. You can set the permissions on the files in /etc/dip for all user access and not have to run as root. For debugging purposes, the -v option echoes all the script lines as they are executed. The echo on and echo 
off commands in script files turn the echoing on or off while executing. The -v option is like having the echo on command set as the first line in the script file.

<BR>

<P>The modem command in the scripts for dip only supports the HAYES parameter. You can set the speed with the speed command. For other parameters of your modem, use the Hayes command set. For example, send ate1v1m1q0\r sends the accompanying string to the 
modem to initialize it.

<BR>

<P>You can send output to the modem (and remote host) with the send command. To wait for a specific string, use the wait command with part of the string you are waiting for. Beware though, that if the string you are waiting for never appears, you can hang 
forever. The sleep command simply pauses the shell execution for the specified number of seconds. All variables for dip must be lowercase and preceded with a dollar sign. The dip program recognizes the following special variables:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">$remote for remote host name

$rmtip for remote host IP address

$local for local host name

$locip for local host IP address

$mtu contains the MTU value for the connection.

_ You get this value from your internet provider.</FONT></PRE>

<P>The get command is dip's way of setting a variable. The following line requests the name of the remote host from the user. The ask parameter tells dip to prompt the user for the input.

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">get $remote ask</FONT></PRE>

<P>The local address for this script is derived when you log into your service provider. The remote host prints out a string of the form Your IP address is zzz.yyy.xxx.www. So the script waits for the Your string and then gets the last word on the line. 
Some SLIP service providers assign you a different address every time you log in, so you have to do this. The way to do this is as follows:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">#

# Get local address from this string.

#

wait Your 10

get $local remote</FONT></PRE>

<P>The default command tells dip to route all default message traffic points to the SLIP link. The default command should be executed just before the mode command.

<BR>

<P>The mode command recognizes either SLIP or CSLIP as a parameter. CSLIP is the compressed SLIP mode. If all goes well, the dip program goes into daemon mode. The dip program executes the ifconfig program to automatically configure your interface as a 
point-to-point link.

<BR>

<P>Finally, to kill an existing dip process, you can use /sbin/dip with the -k option. You should do this when you turn off your machine or log out to free up your phone line.

<NOTE>Read <A HREF="rhl42.htm">Chapter 42</A>, &quot;Networking,&quot; to set your /etc/hosts file. Also, if you are not familiar with the ifconfig and traceroute commands, read the man pages for them. The ifconfig program configures and maintains kernel 
resident network interfaces. The traceroute command is useful in tracking messages as they come and go from your machine on the SLIP link. It is an invaluable tool for debugging.</NOTE>

<BR>

<P>The slattach file is used to connect on a dedicated line to a remote server. If your modem is on /dev/cua2, the command to configure a CSLIP connection is run as root:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"># slattach /dev/cua2 &amp;</FONT></PRE>

<P>You can put this in your rc.inet files if you like. If your service provider does not support CSLIP, you can use the -p slip option to get the uncompressed SLIP mode. Just make sure that you run the same mode as your service provider.

<BR>

<P>Then, you execute the following commands:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"># ifconfig sl0 localhost pointtopoint myrichISP

# route add myrichISP

# route add default gw myrichISP</FONT></PRE>

<P>The first command connects you as a point-to-point to a SLIP connection. (The sl0 is ess el zero.) The next two commands add the node myrichISP (the Internet service provider) as the default route.

<BR>

<P>To kill this connection, you must issue the following commands:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"># route del default

# route del myrichISP

# ifconfig sl0 down

# kill -9 (slAttachPID)</FONT></PRE>

<P>In this case, slAttachPID is the process ID of the slattach process. For more information on setting up SLIP connections, see <A HREF="rhl42.htm">Chapter 42</A>.

<BR>

<P>The Document Title field displays the title assigned to the document you are viewing. Not all authors include document titles when they prepare files. Therefore, sometimes there is a default entry in the Document Title field showing basic information 
about the document and its source.

<BR>

<P>Under the title is the Document URL field, which lists the server type and location, and the path of the document currently being viewed. In the upper-right corner of the Mosaic screen is a globe superimposed on a stylized S. This is the official logo 
for NCSA Mosaic.

<BR>

<P>This globe icon serves two purposes:

<BR>

<OL>

<LI>When a hyperlink is activated by clicking on the word or image, the globe spins and beams of light travel along the segments of the S toward the globe. This movement signifies that your document is being retrieved.

<BR>

<BR>

<LI>You can abort any current document retrieval process by clicking on the globe. The beams of light usually stop when you do this, which in turn indicates that the current transfer has been aborted.

<BR>

<BR>

</OL>

<P>The status line then displays the message. If part of the file was already retrieved without the inline images, the Document View window contains the new document; click the Back button at the bottom of the window to return to the document containing 
the hyperlink.

<BR>

<P>Below the Document URL field is the viewing area, which displays the contents of the current document file. The highlighted or underlined words or images within the viewing area are actually hyperlinks to other files. Use the scroll bar on the right 
side of the viewing area to move up and down in the file contents.

<BR>

<P>Some hyperlinks open in separate windows because they depend on external viewers to display the file contents. This is generally true for movies and for some graphics. To alert you that this is the case, Mosaic displays the message Spawning external 
viewer in the information line at the bottom of the window.

<BR>

<P>If Mosaic attempts to spawn an external viewer that is not installed, an error message may be displayed on the console (xterm) from which Mosaic was executed. NCSA Mosaic may ask you to enter a filename to save the current unidentifiable document.

<BR>

<P>The Document View window also displays the status of the current retrieval process in the information line.

<BR>

<P>Somewhere between the document viewing area and the bottom row of control buttons is an area that Mosaic uses to let you know specific information such as the status of your retrieval of a file, the use of an external viewer, and the URL of a linked

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>

<CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000"><B>The Cursor and Displaying Hyperlink URLs</B></FONT></CENTER></H4>

<BR>

<P>The cursor in Mosaic is generally a standard short arrow pointing slightly to the left of twelve o'clock. The cursor changes its configuration depending on where you are in the Document View window. It is the arrow configuration unless it is pointing to 
a hyperlink.

<BR>

<P>When the cursor rests on a hyperlink, it changes to a small hand icon pointing to the left. At the same time that the cursor changes its configuration, the hyperlink's URL is displayed in the information line. This tells you what will be retrieved if 
you select the hyperlink. The URL may also tell you the format of the document.

<BR>

<P>For example, suppose the URL <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/access/accessDir.html">http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/access/accessDir.html</A> is displayed in the information line. This tells you that the document will be retrieved from the NCSA WWW 
server (www.ncsa.uiuc.edu).

<BR>

<P>If you see the CERN WWW server (info.cern.ch) and an image file extension (.gif), you can surmise that the hyperlink is an image being retrieved from Switzerland and might take longer to download than a local text file. (Of course, your access to the 
Internet plays a part in the retrieval speed; but in general, you should expect links from overseas, as well as image files, to take slightly longer to display.)

</TABLE><P>A browser program then attempts to use this action on the sitename and pathname in the URL. Given this information, you can also write your own HTML documents.

<BR>

<P>You use text anchors to attach links to an HTML document. An anchor is simply a region of text that is reserved as a pointer to another place. In Mosaic these anchors are displayed as underlined text. Other Web viewers may display a link in a different 
font, a different color, or both. The beauty of HTML is that different viewers can show an HTML document in their own style. You are not limited to one type of display with all viewers.

<BR>

<P>HTML anchors take the following form:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;a href=&quot;htmlfile&quot;&gt;GoDocument&lt;/a&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>In this form, &lt;a and /a&gt; are tags that mark the location pointed to by this HTML anchor. Tags are usually paired, with the ending tag having an extra /. The href token specifies the file to get, and the text between the &gt; and &lt; is what you 
see in dashed boxes. Tags are not case-sensitive, so &lt;a&gt; is equal to &lt;A&gt;.

<BR>

<P>In a hypertext document, you can use the following example to mark a link to the &quot;official&quot; list of WWW servers at CERN:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">For List servers at CERN, &lt;a

href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html&quot;

&gt;GoCERN&lt;/a&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>With a browser you see the following line:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">For List servers at CERN, GoCERN.</FONT></PRE>

<P>In this example, the GoCERN text is underlined when it appears on-screen.

<BR>

<P>An HTML document uses tags to specify special areas of the text. The format of an HTML document is loosely described as follows:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;HTML&gt;

&lt;HEAD&gt;

&lt;TITLE&gt;This is a Home Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;

&lt;HEAD&gt;

&lt;BODY&gt;

.... tags ... text .... etc. etc.

&lt;/BODY&gt;

&lt;/HTML&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>There can be only one pair of &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt; tags in the entire HTML document. These are used to store the text for the HTML document. The &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt; tags show the title in the heading section of a viewer. You 
generally have only one such pair in an HTML document because the text in the &lt;/HEAD&gt; applies to the whole document.

<BR>

<P>For example, to show the title in an HTML document, use the following tag:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;TITLE&gt;This is a Home Page For Mosaic!&lt;/TITLE&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>Tags are not case-sensitive, and any formatting in between the tags is almost always ignored. So the previous title could also be written as follows:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;TITLE&gt;

This is

a Home

Page

For

Mosaic!

&lt;/TITLE&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>Paragraphs in an HTML document are introduced with a &lt;P&gt; tag and ended with a &lt;/P&gt; tag. To break a line in the middle, you use the &lt;BR&gt; tag to add a line break.

<BR>

<P>HTML enables you to use up to six levels of headings, numbered H1 through H6; H1 is the leftmost (highest) heading, and H6 is the lowest heading. To define a heading use the following:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;H1&gt;heading 1&lt;/H1&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>Most Mosaic servers define a different point size for the level of heading you are supposed to be on. Don't skip heading titles when writing a document (for instance, don't use level 5 after level 1). It's not considered a good writing style and does 
not show up well on Mosaic viewers. You won't get any errors, but the document will look sloppy.

<BR>

<P>The following tags can be used to specify how to display the text on a viewer:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;I&gt; &lt;/I&gt; italicize the text in between

&lt;B&gt; &lt;/B&gt; bold face the text in between

&lt;U&gt; &lt;/U&gt; underline the text in between</FONT></PRE>

<P>HTML supports unordered lists of items with the, &lt;LI&gt;, &lt;/LI&gt;, and &lt;/UL&gt; tags. To specify such a list, use the following construct:

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;LI&gt; Eat the cake&lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Swim with the fish&lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Start the BBQ &lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Write a chapter &lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;/UL&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>This list is displayed with each item between the &lt;LI&gt; and &lt;/LI&gt; as a bulleted item. Unordered lists are generally used as menu items from which a user can choose an item.

<BR>

<P>To display a numbered list, use an ordered list with &lt;OL&gt; and &lt;/OL&gt; to enclose the list. Technically, you do not need to use the &lt;/LI&gt; for each item, but some browsers may not support it. The previous list could be shown as follows:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Eat the cake&lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Swim with the fish&lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Start the BBQ &lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;LI&gt; Write a chapter &lt;/LI&gt;

&lt;/OL&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>HTML documents enable you to keep a glossary between &lt;DL&gt; and &lt;/DL&gt; tags. Each glossary item contains a pair of &lt;DT&gt; and &lt;DD&gt; tags. The syntax for the glossary is as follows:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;Item&lt;DD&gt;Description of this item in one line.

&lt;DT&gt;Another item &lt;DD&gt;Another One Line Description

&lt;/DL&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>The &lt;DT&gt; tag indicates the beginning of an element within a glossary, followed by the description after the &lt;DD&gt; tag. The glossary item is displayed flushed left on a line by itself, followed by the description with a tab in front of it.

<BR>

<P>If you really want to include source listings and the like, you can put the text between &lt;PRE&gt; and &lt;/PRE&gt; tags. The text between these two tags is displayed literally by your browser.

<BR>

<P>Other types of tags supported by Mosaic include the following:

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;BR&gt; Produce a line break

&lt;HR&gt; Draw a horizontal line

&lt;EM&gt; &lt;/EM&gt; Emphasize in different font (italics in Mosaic)

&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt; Boldface in Mosaic, another font with other browsers.</FONT></PRE>

<P>You can also place images in your document with the &lt;IMG&gt; tag. For example, the construct

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;IMG SRC=http://dont.inhale.com/graphics/billy.gif&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>gets the image billy.gif from the site dont.inhale.com and has the browser display it for you. (If you want to get a better image editor for HTML documents, try mapedit at sunsite.unc.edu in the /pub/packages/info-systems directory.) If you do not 
specify a full address for the image, the browser uses the current page's directory and site.

<BR>

<P>Images that are declared one after another are placed side by side on the user's screen. You can introduce line breaks with the &lt;BR&gt; or &lt;P&gt; tags. You can also annotate the images with the text ALIGN keyword:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;local.gif&quot; ALIGN=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt; annotation</FONT></PRE>

<P>The keywords for the ALIGN keyword are top, middle, and bottom for aligning the annotation text position. In the previous example, the text will be shown on the bottom of the figure.

<BR>

<P>Some text-based browsers are not capable of displaying images that enable you to specify a special character that is displayed instead of the image. The attribute for this special character is the ALT keyword.

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;local.gif&quot; ALIGN=&quot;middle&quot; ALT=&quot;$&quot;&gt; annotation</FONT></PRE>

<P>This shows a dollar sign where the image would be shown on a graphic browser.

<BR>

<P>You can link images to actions within a link pair. For example, the following action gets you an HTML document by clicking or selecting the figure:

<BR>

<BR>

<PRE>

<FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;A HREF=&quot;bozo.html&quot; &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;clown.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;</FONT></PRE>

<P>That's about all I can put in this space about writing HTML documents. You can always find more interesting documents on the Web as you surf. Save these and see how others do their documents. Most of the information on the Web is very helpful in 
teaching you how to write your own Web documents.

<NOTE>Avoid the temptation to put large GIF images in your HTML documents. The time needed to download these large GIF files on 14.4 modems (still a limitation for a lot of dialup users) is very long. No one wants to wait 12 minutes or so for a pretty 1MB 
image to come down, when he or she could be looking at other sites with a faster download. Be considerate of your reader's time and keep the sizes of any included images to a reasonable size, say not more than 20KB. You'll still have enough resolution to 
put your pictures in there.</NOTE>

<BR>

<P>If you can use Mosaic, you can use just about any other browser. All browsers are based on the same basic principles of retrieving and displaying a file by checking the type of data in it. Once you know how to navigate using URLs, surfing the Net 
becomes a task of learning how to use the special keys for your browser to help you customize its functions to best suit your needs.

<BR>

<P>There are many browsers already available for surfing the Net. Also, enhancements are being made to those that already have been out for a while. For example, as we go to print the Netscape 2.0 port to Linux is being completed. You will then have access 
to more features, including Sun Microsystems' JAVA language with multimedia support.
